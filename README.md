# Antisyphon-Getting-Started-With-Packet-Decoding
## Introductory Summary

This comprehensive 4-day training module covers the fundamentals of network packet analysis and decoding, focusing on practical skills for cybersecurity professionals. The course emphasizes hands-on learning through virtual machine labs and real-world packet captures from suspicious network activities. Students learn to use essential tools like tcpdump, tshark, Wireshark, ngrep, and Zeek to analyze network traffic at multiple protocol layers. The training progresses from basic concepts of binary data interpretation to advanced techniques for detecting network attacks, OS fingerprinting, and identifying command & control (C2) channels. Key protocol layers covered include Ethernet (Layer 2), IP (Layer 3), ICMP, UDP, and TCP, with practical applications in network security monitoring, threat detection, and incident response. Real-world examples include analyzing suspicious HTTP sessions, base64-encoded malware payloads, and memory-based attack techniques that bypass traditional antivirus solutions.
